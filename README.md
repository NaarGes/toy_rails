## Ruby on Rails Tutorial second chapter
### toy app application

* Ruby version: 2.3.1
* Rails version: 5.1.4

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

For more information, see the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial* book](http://www.railstutorial.org/book).
